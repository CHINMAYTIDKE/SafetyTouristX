Project Features and Workflow Documentation
=========================================

Project Name: SafeCampus.AI (formerly SafeTourX)
Description: A Student Safety & Housing Protocol integrating AI-driven risk analysis and Algorand blockchain for verified student housing, rent gamification, and secure deposits.

1. Key Features
----------------
a. Verified Student Housing & AI Risk Scoring
   - Listings: Verified Hostels and PGs (e.g., Stanza Living, Zolo, University Hostels).
   - Campus Zones: AI categorizes areas into "Safe Campus Zones" (Green) vs. "High Alert Zones" (Red).
   - Dynamic Pricing: Security deposits are adjusted based on area safety (High Risk = Higher Deposit).

b. Rent Streak Reputation (Gamification)
   - Tenant Score: Dynamic NFT that evolves based on "Months of Rent Paid" (on-chain).
   - Levels:
     1. Fresher Tenant (0-5 Months): Basic status.
     2. Reliable Sophomore (6-12 Months): Low risk tenant.
     3. Dean's List Tenant (12+ Months): Proven reliability.
   - Benefit: High scores unlock **Zero Security Deposit** bookings.

c. Secure Booking with Algorand
   - Smart Escrow: Students pay Security Deposits/Rent using ALGO.
   - Funds Protection: Payment is held in Escrow and only released when the student verifies move-in.
   - Trustless History: Every rent payment builds an immutable "Tenant Resume".

d. Campus Safety & SOS
   - Safety Map: Real-time heatmap of crime/safety around campus.
   - Emergency SOS: One-click alert sends location to University Security and Parents.

2. Workflow Breakdown
----------------------

STEP 1: Student Onboarding
   - Student connects Pera Wallet.
   - AI verifies "Student Identity" (Mocked via ID upload/Face Scan).
   - Profile created: "Student ID: STU-XXXX", "University: Pune University".

STEP 2: Housing Discovery
   - Student browses "Verified Housing" near campus.
   - Listings show "Monthly Rent" and "Distance to Campus".
   - AI highlights if the area is a "Safe Campus Zone".

STEP 3: Gamified Rent Payment
   - Student pays rent/deposit via Pera Wallet.
   - **Rent Streak**: Payment +1 Month to "Tenant Score".
   - **Level Up**: After 6 payments, student becomes a "Reliable Sophomore".
   - **Benefit**: Future security deposits are WAIVED for high-level students.

STEP 4: Move-In & Escrow Release
   - Student arrives at the PG/Hostel.
   - Clicks "Pay Monthly Rent" (Simulates Check-In).
   - Funds released to Landlord.

3. Tech Stack
---------------------------
 Frontend: React.js (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide Icons
 Backend: Node.js, Express.js
 Blockchain: Algorand Testnet, Pera Wallet Connect, Algosdk
 AI Engine: Python (Risk Scoring), Local Face Verification

4. Why Algorand?
------------------------------
   - **Micro-Transactions**: Ideal for monthly rent and small deposit adjustments.
   - **Speed**: <4s finality ensuring students don't wait at the hostel gate.
   - **Transparency**: Creates a public, verifiable "Tenant History" that no landlord can deny.
